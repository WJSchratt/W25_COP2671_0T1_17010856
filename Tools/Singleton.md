The concept of a "Singleton" refers to a design pattern used in software engineering. It ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance¹. Here's a more detailed explanation:

- **Single Instance**: The Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to one single instance. This means that no matter how many times you try to create a new object of this class, you will always get the same instance.
- **Global Access**: It provides a way for other parts of the code to access this single instance easily, usually through a static method.
- **Initialization Control**: The Singleton pattern can also control when the single instance gets created, either at the time of application startup or when it is first needed (lazy initialization).

Here's an example of how a Singleton might be implemented in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Singleton` class has a private constructor to prevent other classes from instantiating it directly. The `getInstance()` method checks if the `instance` is `null`, and if so, it creates a new `Singleton` object and assigns it to `instance`. This ensures that only one instance of `Singleton` exists.

Singletons are commonly used for managing resources such as database connections or configurations where only one instance is needed to coordinate actions across the entire application².

It's important to note that while Singletons can be useful, they should be used sparingly as they can introduce global state into an application, making it harder to test and debug. They can also make it difficult to scale an application if not implemented with thread-safety in mind.
